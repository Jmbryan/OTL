JPL provides an online Ephemeris calculation tool which can be used to generate 
truth data for the DE405 interpolation programs.

The webpage is here:
http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi

To receive values in the form as those computed by niek-ephem, use the following
settings:

    Ephemeris Type:      "Vector Table"
    Target Body:         <one of the bodies supported by DE405> 
    Coordinate Origin:   Solar System Barycenter (SSB) [500@0] 
    Time Span:           Julian Days within 1600-2200 AD.
    Table Settings:      
        output units     -> km & km/d
        quantities code  -> 2 (state vector {x,y,z,vx,vy,vz})
        reference plane  -> Earth mean equator and equinox of reference epoch
        reference system -> ICRF/J2000.0
