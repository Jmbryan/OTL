(1) Getting the Data

The main distribution site for JPL Ephemeris data is located here:
        ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/export/

The "/DE405" subdirectory contains a research paper explaining how the 
Ephemerides were derived.  The actual data is found in "/ascii".  The top level 
"README.txt" gives some helpful overview information, in addition to some 
information about the header format.

The primary source code examples are in "/fortran" and "/C-versions/hoffman".  
There is also a (poorly-written) Java version which is essentially a cut and 
paste of the FORTRAN routines.


(2) The Ephemerides Format

DE405 is a series of coefficients for Chebyshev Polynomials.  The data comes 
distributed in a series of plain-text coefficient files and a single overall 
header file.  Normally, these ASCII files are downloaded and then converted to 
binary (using one of the supplied utilities).  Doing this process manually 
allows for production of subsets of the Ephemerides and ensures the correct 
endian-ness of the data.

The header file, "/ascii/header.405" explains the overall layout and coverage of
the data.  This file is subdivided in to "GROUP <###>" entries.

    GROUP 1010 -> Plain text strings explaining the data source (JPL DE405) and
                  the dates covered (12/9/1599 till 2/20/2201).

    GROUP 1030 -> Three numbers.  The first two are the first and last dates 
                  covered by the Ephemerides (Julian Day).  The third value 
                  indicates the days per record.

    GROUP 1040 -> The constants used when making the Ephemeris calculations.  
                  First comes a numeral indicating the total number of constants
                  (156), followed by the names.  The actual values associated 
                  with each constant are given in GROUP 1041.

    GROUP 1041 -> The values associated with each constant from GROUP 1040.  
                  First comes a number indicating the total number of 
                  constant-values (156).  Then come a series of double precision
                  numbers corresponding to GROUP 1040 entries.  The sixth GROUP 
                  1040 entry is "CLIGHT".  Accordinly, the sixth GROUP 1041 
                  entry is "CLIGHT".

                  Note that these doubles are written in FORTRAN style, and use 
                  a "D" rather than "E" to indicate the exponent.

    GROUP 1050 -> Layout information of each coefficient file.  The thirteen 
                  columns represent the following astronomical entities:

                      Column        Entity
                        1           Mercury
                        2           Venus
                        3           Earth/Moon Barycenter
                        4           Mars
                        5           Jupiter
                        6           Saturn
                        7           Uranus
                        8           Neptune
                        9           Pluto
                        10          Moon (Geocenter)
                        11          Sun
                        12          Terrestrial Nutations
                        13          Lunar Librations

                  The first row gives the starting location, in a given record, 
                  of the Chebyshev coefficients for that entity.  The second row
                  indicates the degree of the interpolating polynomials (there 
                  is one for each dimension).  The third row indicates the 
                  number of polynomials used to cover the record.

                  For example: 
                  Mercury uses polynomials of degree 14.  Each 32 day record has
                  is subdivided in to 4 segments (each covering an 8 day span).
                  The coefficients start at the third double-precision value in 
                  each record.  (Values 1 and 2 are the Julian start/end day for
                  that record).

                  The coefficients for Venus start at 171.  
                  171 - 3 = 168 coeffs for Mercury.
                  168 / 4 = 42 coeffs for each 8 day period.
                  42 / 3 = 14 coeffs for each of the three polynomials covering 
                              the x, y, and z dimensions.
                  
                  Entities 1 through 11 have three components at each 
                  subdivision (one for x, y, and z).  Entity 12 has two 
                  components: d(psi) and d(epsilon).  Entity 13 has three euler 
                  angles for components.

    GROUP 1070 -> Marks the start of the data.  Note that this is empty in the 
                  header file.  The ASCII coefficient files could be appended 
                  here and produce a single large file with a coherent format. 

The ASCII datafiles are separated in to 20 year blocks.  They are named:

    /ascii/ascp1600.405
    /ascii/ascp1620.405
    /ascii/ascp1640.405
           .
           .
           .
    /ascii/ascp2200.405

The four digit number in the filename indicates the starting year of the block.  
Each block is subdivided in to a series of records, each covering 32 days.  For 
each astronomical entity, these records are further subdivided accordingly to 
the layout described in GROUP 1050 of the header file.

Inside the file, each record is marked by two integers.  The first is the record
number, starting at 1.  The second is the number of coefficients in the record 
(1018).  The first two double precision number of each record show the start and
end Julian Day covered by the record.  (These will always be 32 days apart).  
Next come the 1018 coefficients.  As explained in GROUP 1050, They have the 
following ordering:

    32-Day Block
        Mercury

                14 coefficients for y dimension            offset 17
                14 coefficients for z dimension            offset 31

            Mercury subdivision #2                         
                14 coefficients for x dimension            offset 45
                14 coefficients for y dimension            offset 59

                14 coefficients for x dimension            offset 87
                14 coefficients for y dimension            offset 101
                14 coefficients for z dimension            offset 115

            Mercury subdivision #4                         
                14 coefficients for x dimension            offset 129
                14 coefficients for y dimension            offset 143
                14 coefficients for z dimension            offset 157

        Venus                                             
            Venus subdivision #1
                14 coefficients for x dimension            offset 171
                  .
                  .
                  .        

Note that all position/velocity answers are given in the International 
Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) with one exception.  The data for the 
moon is given relative to the Earth.  The ephemerides tell us the 
location of the Earth-Moon Barycenter.  Using the relative masses of the
moon and the earth (EMRAT in JPL 405 header file), we can computer the 
position of the earth and the moon.
