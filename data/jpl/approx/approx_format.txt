These data are to be used as described in the related document
titled "Keplerian Elements for Approximate Positions of the
Major Planets" by E.M. Standish (JPL/Caltech) available from
the JPL Solar System Dynamics web site (http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/).

Keplerian elements and their rates, with respect to the mean ecliptic and equinox of J2000.
NOTE: the computation of M must be augmented by the additional terms given below.

The planet ephemeris data is stored in the following order with units shown:
a             e               I                L                long.peri.      long.node.
AU, AU/Cy     rad, rad/Cy     deg, deg/Cy      deg, deg/Cy      deg, deg/Cy     deg, deg/Cy

The additional terms for computing M are stored in the following order:
b    c    s    f

The JplApproximateData.dat file is organized in the following format (all values are space delimited):
